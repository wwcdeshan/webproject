                    <h2><b>What is Sustainable Development?</b></h2>
                    <p1><i><b>"Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</b></i></p1>
                         <p>Sustainability means meeting our own needs without   compromising the ability of future generations to meet their   own needs. In addition to natural resources,
                              we also need social and economic resources. Sustainability is not just environmentalism. Embedded in most definitions of sustainability we also find concerns for social equity and economic development.</p>

                    <div class="para2">
                    <h2>Where does the term come from?</h2>     
                          <p>While the concept of sustainability is a relatively new idea, the movement as a whole has roots in social justice, conservationism, internationalism and other past movements with rich histories.  
                               By the end of the twentieth centuries, many of these ideas had come together in the call for ‘sustainable development.’</p> 
                            <p>In 1983, the United Nations tapped former Norwegian prime   minister Gro Harlem Brundtland to  run the  new  World Commission on Environment and Development1.  After decades of effort to raise living standards through industrialization, many countries were still dealing with extreme poverty. It seemed that economic   development at the cost of ecological health and social equity   did not lead to long-lasting prosperity. It was clear that the   world needed to find a way to harmonize ecology with prosperity. After four years, the “Brundtland Commission” released its   f inal report, 
                                 Our Common Future.  It famously defines sustainable development as: </p>

                          <h4>Environmental Sustainability</h4> 
                          <p>Ecological integrity is maintained, all of earth’s environmental systems are kept in balance while natural resources 
                              within them are consumed by humans at a rate where they are able   to replenish themselves.</p> 
                              <h4>Economic Sustainability</h4>      
                              <p>Human communities across the globe are able to maintain   their independence and have access to the resources that they require, financial and other, to meet their needs. Economic   
                                  systems are intact and activities are available to everyone,   such as secure sources of livelihood.</p>      
                                  <h4>Social Sustainability </h4>   
                                  <p>Universal human rights and basic necessities are attainable by all people, who have access to enough resources in order to keep their families and communities healthy and secure. Healthy communities have just leaders who ensure personal, 
                                      labour and cultural rights are respected and all people are   protected from discrimination.</p>

   <h2> Why sustainability? </h2>
     <p>  The motivations behind sustainability are often complex,   personal and diverse. It is unrealistic to create a list of reasons why so many individuals, groups and communities are working towards this goal.  Yet, for most people, sustainability comes down  to  the  kind  of  future  we  are  leaving  for  the  next  generation. Sustainability as a value is shared by many individuals and   organizations who demonstrate this value in their policies,   everyday activities and behaviours. Individuals have played   a major role in developing our current environmental and   social circumstances. 
    The people of today along with future   generations must create solutions and adapt. </p>
